# RPOST

A (R)aspberry (P)i (model 4B, mainly) (O)peration (S)ystem (T)rainwreck experiment
to learn more about the Rust lang, bare-metal programming and (obviously) 
operating systems design and architecture.

The code follows the code presented [rust-embedded's Raspberry Pi OS tutorials](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master),
but maybe it will evolve beyond the tutorial's scope and grow a personality and such.
If that happens, it will be probably a good idea to rebrand this very tasteful
project name.
